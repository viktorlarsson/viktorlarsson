### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Viktor SarstrÃ¶m, 34 years old based in Gothenburg and currently working at @evolvetechnology. I'm that full-stack employees that everyone is looking for. I've been working with computers since I was born and I will probably die in front of one. I love breaking down walls at companies and building digital solutions in close collaboration after they are down. Inequality in this business is a fact and we need to change this together.
